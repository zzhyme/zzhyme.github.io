              <p class = "info">According to Ms. Jamirah Nicole Bolledo her logo features her business name, “Likha,” which means “to create” or “creation”, representing the creativity, effort, and artistry that go into every handmade vintage paper she makes.
                The design shows an old envelope sealed with wax and marked with her initial "J" for Jamirah. It reflects what receive customers when they buy her product, each order feels like opening a mail letter. There's also a garlic element in the 
                logo to show that the papers are made from garlic skins, highlighting their unique and eco-friendly origin.
